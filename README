Features
--------

* readable code (even pylint and pep8 like it)
* URL validation: infinite redirects/loops, same url as host, URL form validation
* unit tests
* UI tests (with selenium)
* performance tests (with grequests)
* keys are case insensitive, start small (from '1'!) and grow predictably ('a1z9', 'a1za', 'a1zb'... )
